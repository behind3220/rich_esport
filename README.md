# Rich Esport

This project explored the possibilities of profit from League of Legends pro games.
We trained several classification models by using the open-source dataset.
This dataset contained the first 10 minutes of each game.
The ranked games were ranged from Diamond I to Master or higher, which simulated the pro-players' level in a real e-sport game.
After training, we used the model which had the best performance to predict the result of a real-time game.
Finally, we obtained **over 75%** accuracy on the test data.
